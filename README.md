# Template Bun

A template for creating a Bun TypeScript project in my personal style.

It has my custom CI/CD setup and containerization for easy deployment.

### Local Development

_Ensure to rename the `name` property in `package.json` to your project name, this should also match the repo name. This is important for the CI/CD pipeline._

`bun dev` - Starts the development server.

### GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The workflow is triggered on commits to the `main` branch. A container is built and pushed to the repository.

Currently this only keeps the latest build of the application and remove previous versions. I do this personally so that I don't exceed GitHub storage quotas.

When redeploying the application, the latest build is forcably pulled from the repository. This is done to ensure that the latest version of the application is always deployed.

### Production

The production environment is set up to use the container built in the CI/CD pipeline. The container is deployed to a server using Docker Compose.

The `ci.sh` script runs git pull to ensure that the latest version of the code is pulled from the repository. It then runs `deploy.sh` to deploy the container.

A webhook is set up to trigger the deployment when a new container is pushed to the repository.
